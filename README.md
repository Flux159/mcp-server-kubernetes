## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

Before using this MCP server with any tool, make sure you have:

1. kubectl installed and in your PATH
2. A valid kubeconfig file with contexts configured
3. Access to a Kubernetes cluster configured for kubectl (e.g. minikube, Rancher Desktop, GKE, etc.)
4. Helm v3 installed and in your PATH (no Tiller required). Optional if you don't plan to use Helm.

You can verify your connection by running `kubectl get pods` in a terminal to ensure you can connect to your cluster without credential issues.

By default, the server loads kubeconfig from `~/.kube/config`. For additional authentication options (environment variables, custom paths, etc.), see [ADVANCED_README.md](ADVANCED_README.md).

### Claude Code

Add the MCP server to Claude Code using the built-in command:

```bash
claude mcp add kubernetes -- npx mcp-server-kubernetes
```

This will automatically configure the server in your Claude Code MCP settings.

### Claude Desktop

Add the following configuration to your Claude Desktop config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kubernetes": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-kubernetes"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop Connector via mcpb

MCP Server Kubernetes is also available as a [mcpb](https://github.com/anthropics/mcpb) (formerly dxt) extension. In Claude Desktop, go to Settings (`Cmd+,` on Mac) -> Extensions -> Browse Extensions and scroll to find mcp-server-kubernetes in the modal. Install it & it will install & utilize kubectl via command line & your kubeconfig.

To manually install, you can also get the .mcpb by going to the latest [Release](https://github.com/Flux159/mcp-server-kubernetes/releases) and downloading it.

### VS Code

[![Install Kubernetes MCP in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20Kubernetes%20MCP%20in%20VS%20Code-blue?logo=visualstudiocode)](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%20%22kubernetes%22%2C%20%22type%22%3A%20%22stdio%22%2C%20%22command%22%3A%20%22npx%22%2C%20%22args%22%3A%20%5B%22mcp-server-kubernetes%22%5D%7D)

For VS Code integration, you can use the MCP server with extensions that support the Model Context Protocol:

1. Install a compatible MCP extension (such as Claude Dev or similar MCP clients)
2. Configure the extension to use this server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kubernetes": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-kubernetes"],
      "description": "Kubernetes cluster management and operations"
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

Cursor supports MCP servers through its AI integration. Add the server to your Cursor MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kubernetes": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-kubernetes"]
    }
  }
}
```

The server will automatically connect to your current kubectl context. You can verify the connection by asking the AI assistant to list your pods or create a test deployment.

## Usage with mcp-chat

[mcp-chat](https://github.com/Flux159/mcp-chat) is a CLI chat client for MCP servers. You can use it to interact with the Kubernetes server.

```shell
npx mcp-chat --server "npx mcp-server-kubernetes"
```

Alternatively, pass it your existing Claude Desktop configuration file from above (Linux should pass the correct path to config):

Mac:

```shell
npx mcp-chat --config "~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json"
```

Windows:

```shell
npx mcp-chat --config "%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json"
```

  - Verify connection with `ping`
- [x] Advanced operations
  - Scale deployments with `kubectl_scale` (replaces legacy `scale_deployment`)
  - Port forward to pods and services with `port_forward`
  - Run Helm operations
    - Install, upgrade, and uninstall charts
    - Support for custom values, repositories, and versions
    - Template-based installation (`helm_template_apply`) to bypass authentication issues
    - Template-based uninstallation (`helm_template_uninstall`) to bypass authentication issues

## Prompts

The MCP Kubernetes server includes specialized prompts to assist with common diagnostic operations.

### /k8s-diagnose Prompt

This prompt provides a systematic troubleshooting flow for Kubernetes pods. It accepts a `keyword` to identify relevant pods and an optional `namespace` to narrow the search.
The prompt's output will guide you through an autonomous troubleshooting flow, providing instructions for identifying issues, collecting evidence, and suggesting remediation steps.

## Local Development

Make sure that you have [bun installed](https://bun.sh/docs/installation). Clone the repo & install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Flux159/mcp-server-kubernetes.git
cd mcp-server-kubernetes
bun install
```

### Development Workflow

1. Start the server in development mode (watches for file changes):

```bash
bun run dev
```

2. Run unit tests:

```bash
bun run test
```

3. Build the project:

```bash
bun run build
```

4. Local Testing with [Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector)

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js
# Follow further instructions on terminal for Inspector link
```

5. Local testing with Claude Desktop

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-kubernetes": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/your/mcp-server-kubernetes/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

6. Local testing with [mcp-chat](https://github.com/Flux159/mcp-chat)

```bash
bun run chat
```

### Non-Destructive Mode

You can run the server in a non-destructive mode that disables all destructive operations (delete pods, delete deployments, delete namespaces, etc.):

```shell
ALLOW_ONLY_NON_DESTRUCTIVE_TOOLS=true npx mcp-server-kubernetes
```

For Claude Desktop configuration with non-destructive mode:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kubernetes-readonly": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-kubernetes"],
      "env": {
        "ALLOW_ONLY_NON_DESTRUCTIVE_TOOLS": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Commands Available in Non-Destructive Mode

All read-only and resource creation/update operations remain available:

- Resource Information: `kubectl_get`, `kubectl_describe`, `kubectl_logs`, `explain_resource`, `list_api_resources`
- Resource Creation/Modification: `kubectl_apply`, `kubectl_create`, `kubectl_scale`, `kubectl_patch`, `kubectl_rollout`
- Helm Operations: `install_helm_chart`, `upgrade_helm_chart`, `helm_template_apply`, `helm_template_uninstall`
- Connectivity: `port_forward`, `stop_port_forward`
- Context Management: `kubectl_context`

### Commands Disabled in Non-Destructive Mode

The following destructive operations are disabled:

- `kubectl_delete`: Deleting any Kubernetes resources
- `uninstall_helm_chart`: Uninstalling Helm charts
- `cleanup`: Cleanup of managed resources
- `cleanup_pods`: Cleaning up problematic pods
- `node_management`: Node management operations (can drain nodes)
- `kubectl_generic`: General kubectl command access (may include destructive operations)

For additional advanced features, see the [ADVANCED_README.md](ADVANCED_README.md) and also the [docs](https://github.com/Flux159/mcp-server-kubernetes/tree/main/docs) folder for specific information on `helm_install`, `helm_template_apply`, node management & pod cleanup.

## Publishing new release

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/Flux159/mcp-server-kubernetes/releases), click on "Draft New Release", click "Choose a tag" and create a new tag by typing out a new version number using "v{major}.{minor}.{patch}" semver format. Then, write a release title "Release v{major}.{minor}.{patch}" and description / changelog if necessary and click "Publish Release".

This will create a new tag which will trigger a new release build via the cd.yml workflow. Once successful, the new release will be published to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-server-kubernetes). Note that there is no need to update the package.json version manually, as the workflow will automatically update the version number in the package.json file & push a commit to main.

## Not planned

Adding clusters to kubectx.
